## About Me

I'm Kerem, I'm a Technology Enthusiast with a passion for Network Systems and System Administration. I enjoy diving deep into the IT Infrastructure to keep systems running smoothly and securely.

Configure Firewalls and Servers, route network traffic efficiently and manage unwanted requests to improve System and Network performance as much as possible.

Actively spend time with things like OPNsense, Proxmox, Linux Systems (Fedora, Debian etc), Ansible and try to make them work for long periods of time and not cause problems.
